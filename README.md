# GorillaBet
_Automated Betting Software_

GorillaBet is an experimental software aiming at finding profitable odds for football matches in the Serie A league.

Although the mathematical analysis can be run without an API key, such key is needed to obtain the odds from BWin. Keys must be stored in a separate file named ``` API_keys.txt ``` under the form ``` user_key = "1234abcd" ```.

Results from the previous season can be seen by running ``` results.py ```.
